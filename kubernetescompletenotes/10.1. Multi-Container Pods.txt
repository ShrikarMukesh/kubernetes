Multi-Container Pods
================================
10.1. Multi-Container Pods
================================
=> Kubernetes doesnâ€™t run containers directly

=> Kubernetes  wraps one or more containers into a higher-level structure called Pod. 

=> Pod is a group of one or more containers that are deployed together on the same host. 

=> Pod is deployed with with shared storage and network resources, and a specification for how to run the containers.

=> Containers can easily communicate with other containers in the same pod as though they are on the same machine.


=> If you need to run a single container in Kubernetes, then you have to create a pod for it which is nothing but Single Container Pod.

=>  If you have to run two or more containers in a pod, then the pod created to place these containers is called a Multi Container Pod.

=> Multi-Containers in Pods can share same lifecycle
	*** Created together
	*** Destroyed together
	*** Access Same shared storage
	*** Access Same network resources(Refer each other as localhost)
