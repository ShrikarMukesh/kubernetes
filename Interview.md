ReplicaController and ReplicaSet are both Kubernetes objects used for managing replicated Pods, ensuring a desired number of replicas are running at any given time. However, they are from different versions of Kubernetes and have some differences:

1. **ReplicationController**:
   - ReplicationController was the original Kubernetes object for managing replica sets of Pods.
   - It ensures that a specified number of Pod replicas are running at any one time.
   - It doesn't support the more advanced selector options available in ReplicaSets.
   - It is considered legacy and has been replaced by ReplicaSets in Kubernetes.

2. **ReplicaSet**:
   - ReplicaSet is the successor to ReplicationController and offers more features and flexibility.
   - It allows more expressive pod selectors, including the use of set-based selectors.
   - It is the preferred way to manage replica sets of Pods in Kubernetes.
   - It provides better support for rolling updates and scaling.

In essence, ReplicaSets are an evolution of ReplicationControllers, offering more functionality and flexibility in managing Pod replicas. As a best practice, it's recommended to use ReplicaSets or Deployments (which manage ReplicaSets) instead of ReplicationControllers for managing Pods in Kubernetes clusters, as they provide more robust features for managing applications.
